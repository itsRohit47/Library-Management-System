Library Management System is a ‘program’ which can help librarians in many ways. Its written in Python 3 with tkinter library and uses MySQL as the database.

Note: Don't mind the code quality here, as this code was written back when i was in year 12 as a school project and at that time i was not really aware about coding standards and best practices.

Some important functions of this program are:

- Book issuing
- Book Return
- Book Stock Management
- Student Library cards management
- Searching Books
- Searching Student
